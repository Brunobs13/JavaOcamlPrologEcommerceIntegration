# Portfolio-Ready Materials

## LinkedIn Version (Short)
Rebuilt a legacy **Java + OCaml + Prolog e-commerce project** into a production-structured integration platform with API endpoints, live commerce dashboard, Docker deployment, CI pipeline, and enterprise-grade documentation.

## CV Version (Technical)
Modernized a monolithic multilingual repository into a layered integration architecture. Implemented Prolog rule parsing, quote/order orchestration, inventory-aware transaction flow, integration health probes for Java/OCaml/Prolog assets, and a responsive operations dashboard. Added automated tests, Dockerization, CI validation, and technical interview documentation.

## 60-Second Pitch
I transformed a legacy academic polyglot commerce repository into a production-style platform. The new architecture separates API, core domain, and pricing engine layers, while preserving original Java/OCaml/Prolog assets for traceability. The service now exposes quote and order endpoints, computes discounts and shipping from Prolog rules, tracks operational metrics, and powers a live dashboard. I also added tests, CI, Docker, and complete documentation, making the project interview-ready and deployable.

## 5-Minute Technical Pitch
The original project had interesting cross-language intent but was not structured for production. I first isolated legacy code in a dedicated archive to preserve historical context. Then I built a clean service architecture with typed models, deterministic parsing of Prolog pricing rules, and a runtime engine responsible for quote and order computations.

From there, I exposed operational APIs and built a dashboard where stakeholders can simulate carts, generate quotes, register orders, and monitor inventory and revenue metrics in real time. To professionalize delivery, I added environment-based configuration, test automation, CI workflows, and Docker packaging.

This creates a credible enterprise narrative: modernize a polyglot legacy codebase into a stable API-first platform while retaining legacy assets and preparing for gradual migration.
